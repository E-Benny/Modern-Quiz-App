## Quiz App Design

This modern version of a quiz was developed using HTML and CSS. This design was inspired by some of the past tests I have taken in college.

## Installation

This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Just open the HTML file to use it.

## Project Status

The project runs as expected. I did not implement any JavaScript or PHP code, thus any information entered into the radio buttons will not trigger a function or event.

## Live Version

To view the live version of the code without downloading the HTML file, please click on the CodePen link ( https://codepen.io/E-Benny/pen/podaVqX ).
